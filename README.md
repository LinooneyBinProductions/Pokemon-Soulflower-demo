1. Dowload the Soulflower demo patch, as well as a ROM of Pokemon Firered (Version 1.0 required)  
2. Apply the patch to the ROM via the internet (google "apply patch to rom")
3. Play on a GBA emulator

No title screen yet, you're playing the right version if Prof. Oak sends out a Pichu instead of Nidoran.

Bug: there are 3 gift pokemon in the demo, and their nicknames don't seem to stick if they get sent to PC
